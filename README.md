# To Do App - Scala 

A small to-do-list application made using Scala (JVM) and the Play framework to give me a brief introduction to Scala and the Play framework. 

I hope to use Scala JS for other projects too. 

After cloning the repository, I believe "sbt run" should run the application on the localhost's port 9000.
